Four months project in collaboration with Digital Bros Game Academy and AvantGarden Games.
This game is a melee multiplayer battle royale, where you can play in a team of maximum three players and fight in a planet that has four different size phases, every few minutes the planet will shrink itself until it reaches the final form, a very little one, in which every player has to encounter the survivors and try to win the game.

In this project I worked on lobby management and key in-game multiplayer mechanics, like team spawns and equipment functioning, using the Mirror package, as well as implementing the inventory, the equip and drop mechanics, most of the item's data structure, most of the UI elements and all of the sounds in the game.

### Tome Keeper

One month project in collaboration with Digital Bros Game Academy.
A first person simulator game, where you play as a librarian in a magical library.
Every night in the library a ghost appears and starts to enchants every books, so in order to keep the library quiet and order, you must capture the possessed books, put them in their correct place and seal the ghost before the library's order run out.
In this project I worked on the gameplay structure, the books and ghosts AI's behaviour, the UI implementation and functions, the gameplay's loop and all of the sounds in the game.
