- Four months project in collaboration with Digital Bros Game Academy and AvantGarden Games, created with Unity.
This game is a melee multiplayer battle royale, where you can play in a team of maximum three players and fight in a planet that has four different size phases, every few minutes the planet will shrink itself until it reaches the final form, a very little one, in which every player has to encounter the survivors and try to win the game.
